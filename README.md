# KACOS
This is the Debian live configuration for KACOS.

## Building and testing
**_NOTE:_** *You need to be a Debian based system to configure and build KACOS*
You need to install the requirements from [live-team.pages.debian.net](https://live-team.pages.debian.net/live-manual/html/live-manual.en.html#112).  
Then configure it with `lb config`.  
and finally build it with `lb build`.  
After that you can run the built ISO file `live-image-amd64.hybrid.iso` in a VM or on a USB stick.
